# Tags üè∑
**Bookmarking app for images**

**Tags** is a side project idea that I completed in a little under 2 weeks after using apps like Pocket and Instapaper. I was curious on how these apps interact with the share sheet across different applications and are able to save images, URLs, text etc and display them to the user in a seamless way.

While working on **Tags**, I reused a couple of components that I learned in my previous project like Combine, threading for UI updates, UITableView/UICollectionView customization and more. I also came across a bunch of newer learnings (Share Extension, Targets, App Group Containers, etc) that I would suggest you go check out in my blog () if you are curious! 

- Sharing my iOS dev journey along with "building in public" has been a revitalizing approach that I have implemented that has kept me accountable and has taught me a ton as I work on these side projects - I recommend any newer dev to implement this approach to your journey and see how it improves your results.

## Notes and Screenshots

Once again the UI is pretty minimal as I was just using this project as a way to learn more things in iOS dev land, although I did implement a pretty nifty trick with the HomeViewController tableview (tappable section headers and disappearing rows). A big part of this app was the data persistence, updating the data correctly throughout the app and share extension and passing data amongst multiple surfaces.

There's also a couple of TODO's sprinkled through the app of things I would like to implement, do in a different way or downright fix that I plan to get to hopefully in the future as I flesh this app a bit more! _(hopefully this doesn't enter the side project graveyard ü§£)_

Here are some screenshots of different actions throughout the app:

### Home Refresh 
note: I added a manual refresh to the Home table view. Ideally, I would want the tags to refresh when I come back to the app from the share extension. If you see how I can do this, please share!
